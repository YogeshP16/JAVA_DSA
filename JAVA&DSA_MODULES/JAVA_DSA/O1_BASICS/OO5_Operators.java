Operators in Java
What are Operators? Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They are fundamental in Java for manipulating data.

Types of Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math operations.

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)

Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values.

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)

Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

&& (AND)
|| (OR)
! (NOT)

Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

= (Assign)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)

Unary Operators
Used on a single operand.

+ (Unary plus)
- (Unary minus)
++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)
! (Logical NOT)

Bitwise Operators
Used to perform bit-level operations.

& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
>>> (Unsigned right shift)

Ternary Operator
A shorthand for an if-else statement.
